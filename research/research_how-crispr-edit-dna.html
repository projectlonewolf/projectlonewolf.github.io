                                Notes and Summary
                            </h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                           Everything is defined by its genes. Genes are basically the basis
                           of our every trait. Scientists have been working a new technology
                           which allows to edit the genes or organisms and change the traits.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            CRISPR is the cheapest, most effective and most efficient way to edit
                            DNA. Surprisingly, it allows for basically any kind of editing to
                            any gene. Another protein called Cas9 is used to actually spot the
                            gene and then chop it off. The rest of the gene is then replaced
                            with the edited version.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Cas9 then has a target RNA which is used to guide protein to actually
                            find the DNA and then edit it. The target RNA is then used to guide
                            the protein to the gene to be edited.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The CRISPR Cas9 complex thus allows for a basically unlimited
                            number of different changes to be made to any gene. Once the DNA
                            is cut, the cells try to repair it, but scientists give the DNA
                            a specific blueprint to guide the repair, it works when naturally
                            it leads to mistakes, so with the CRISPR technology, the DNA is
                            repaired successfully.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Additionally, CRISPR allows to reprogram all types or organisms,
                            not just humans, so it could be used for plants or animals even.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ultimately, the only limitation to CRISPR is ethics, and the
                            fact that it is a new technology, so it is not yet widely
                            understood.
