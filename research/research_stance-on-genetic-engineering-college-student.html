                        <p>
                            I talked to a student who is studying
                            computational biology at Brown University.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I asked him about his stance and experiences
                            with the ethical concerns and implications of
                            genetic engineering and how it should or should
                            not be used in society.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            I talked to Brian Kirz, a college student who is
                            studying computational biology at Brown University.
                            I asked him about what he thinks about how we should
                            or should not go about using genetic engineering in
                            society and how he belives it should be distributed
                            and allowed in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           He states that he belives that it should be available
                           and distributed to <i>everyone</i> fairly, meaning
                           that everyone should have access to it, by it either
                           being paid for by the government or by the individual.
                           He additionally said that he belives it's revolutionary
                           and would make way groundbreaking scientific advances
                           in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also asked him about what he thinks of genetic
                            screening of sperm and eggs to control and prevent
                            any unwanted genetic mutations, and how he views
                            the way it should, or not, be done.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Brain said that he belives that it should be allowed
                            only if it is to prevent serious, life-damaging
                            diseases, and not to prevent small, or irrelevant
                            conditions / diseases or just to select the "fastest,
                            better, stronger" embryos.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then followed up with him about why he views this
                            differently from how he views other genetic engineering
                            methods such as actually altering the DNA of live, pre-
                            existing cells of organisms. To which he said that he
                            actually views them both the same, because he meant that
                            he only belives that the actual modification of live cells
                            and DNA of living organisms should only be allowed if it is to
                            fix those previously said life-altering and life-damaging
                            diseases, and not to just make the fully grown adult "better,
                            faster, stronger", etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aditionally, just out of curiosity, I also asked him about
                            what he thinks about vaccines and their availability and even
                            potential imbalance they might cause. This is because in some
                            places, such as Brazil for example, only vaccines that are
                            absolutely crucial and necessary are actually given out for
                            free. On the other hand, vaccines that aren't for diseases as
                            serious, are <i>not</i> given out for free, thus being a direct
                            contradiction to being able to the argument of not being able to
                            screen gametes before fertilization, as it allows the rich, who
                            have access to this technology to be <i>genetically</i> superior
                            to the poor, who don't; and although both are not the same, it is
                            a similar argument / discussion.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To this, he responded that he thinks that vaccines should be available
                            for free for everyone, as is in lots of developed countries or even just
                            a lot more affordable. He also rebutted that in most countries already,
                            vaccines are already available for free, to which I agree with.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Overall, I belive I benefitted immensely from this interview. I got
                            tons of insights into the ethical concerns and implications that are
                            present in an actual academic enviroment and how they should or should
                            not be applied and utilized. I also got to realize that the way I
                            was thinking about genetic engineering in the past, was not necessarily
                            the way I would be thinking about it now, as it has allowed me to see
                            the whole field from another perpespective. Aditionally, although I
                            didn't completely agree with all of his ideas and arguments, I understood
                            where he was coming from, and we had a lot of really interesting and
                            thought provoking conversations. In conclusion, it was great to talk
                            to Brian about this, and it was a super interesting conversation and
                            experience.
