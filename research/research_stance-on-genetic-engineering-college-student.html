                        <p>
                            I talked to a student who is studying
                            computational biology at Brown University.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I asked him about his stance and experiences
                            with the ethical concerns and implications of
                            genetic engineering and how it should or should
                            not be used in society.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            I talked to Brian Kirz, a college student who is
                            studying computational biology at Brown University.
                            I asked him about what he thinks about how we should
                            or should not go about using genetic engineering in
                            society and how he belives it should be distributed
                            and allowed in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           He states that he belives that it should be available
                           and distributed to <i>everyone</i> fairly, meaning
                           that everyone should have access to it, by it either
                           being paid for by the government or by the individual.
                           He additionally said that he belives it's revolutionary
                           and would make way groundbreaking scientific advances
                           in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also asked him about what he thinks of genetic
                            screening of sperm and eggs to control and prevent
                            any unwanted genetic mutations, and how he views
                            the way it should, or not, be done.
                        </p>
