                                Description
                            </h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            For my social project goal I chose, I will be starting a project
                            to teach and show people how genetic engineering can be used for
                            amazing things, thus supporting my stance on genetic engineering.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3>
                                Ideas
                            </h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The actual project could be several different things, but in
                            talking to friends and family, I came up with the idea of a
                            website where people could run simulations of different forms
                            of reproduction, and see how people would change throughout
                            generations based on a predetermined set of parents and rules.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aditionally, I think there should be a way where the user could
                            also edit some of the people on the simulation's genes and see
                            how that plays out. My brother is also really interested in
                            genetics, so I think it would be amazing to be able to work with
                            him on this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another idea I had was to create posts on social media where I
                            could share fun facts about genetic engineering and how it can
                            be used to make a difference in the world. Especially with the
                            use of GMO's; also I read about this somewhere, but I remember
                            there is some sort of bacteria that creates insulin, which would
                            be super interesting to write about. So maybe I could create like
                            an Instagram and Tiktok account and just post some fun facts that
                            would make people interested, and also share my stance, but also
                            just educate people about what genetic engineering is and how it
                            can be used for good.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Also, I think I could create the social media accounts, and then
                            relate them to the website simulations, as I think that would take
                            a bit longer, and since they're both similar, it would work well
                            to have a preexisting audience for both.
                        </p>
