                            For my social project goal I chose, I will be starting a project
                            to teach and show people how genetic engineering can be used for
                            amazing things, thus supporting my stance on genetic engineering.

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            So during this time between last entry, I've been working on a lot
                            of different aspects of the project. I created the social media accounts
                            on both TikTok and Instagram with the "@thegenesproject" handle for both.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I posted a slideshow of some interesting uses for genetic engineering on the
                            Instagram account already, and althought it works, it did not do that well.
                            I created another post a couple minutes ago and will be posting that later,
                            but I expect the account to get a lot more popular once more friends start
                            following it and I create a few more posts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the other hand, I have no idea what to post on the TikTok account for now.
                            Although I could use the Instagram posts I already made, I don't think they
                            would work well for TikTok, but I might just make some videos with voiceovers
                            of me reading aloud the posts basically.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the other front, the simulator still hasn't been worked on much, but I
                            expect to start working on it with my brother soon. Basically the idea that
                            we're going through with is having the "user" be able to pick out the traits
                            of the 2 original parents, and having an image for each trait etc. (it sounds
                            complicated, but it's probably not), and have each generation have the offspring
                            mate with a randomly created mate and see how the offsrping is like, and so on.
                            Then, if we do finish that properly, we can simulate some of the other types of
                            genetic engineering and breeding and just seeing how far we can go with that.
                        </p>
