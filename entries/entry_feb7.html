                        <p>
                            The "Bias Analysis" article was an activity for our class
                            to analyze and try to notice how some articles can be biased,
                            and it's important to be able to notice and observe these
                            things so we can prevent misinformation and fake news.

                        <p>
                            The article argues that the activists in wealthy countries and
                            conditions such as the US and Europe are blocking African countries
                            to erradicating malaria in their country, while the same has been
                            done in the US and European countries such as Italy. Therewhich have
                            had been no negative side-effects if they had used CRIPR.
                            Wiping them out in African would be safer, as it wouldn't kill
                            other organisms in the ecosystem such as plants, birds, etc.

                        <p>
                            GM Crops can have higher yields than
                            normal crops, and can also have more
                            nutritional value. Usually, cotton,
                            soy beans, maize, and canola are the
                            most commonly genetically modified
                            crops.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Usually, pesticides have been used to
                            prevent crops from being eaten by other
                            organisms. There have been genetic
                            modification for insecticides and weed-
                            killer preventer.

                        <p>
                            An example of this is golden rice, which
                            have been genetically modified to provide
                            more vitamin-A which most have defficiencies
                            of. There has been reasearch to investigate
                            health and enviromental risks.

                        <p>
                            Although medical uses are usually accepted,
                            uses in nutrition have had controversy.
                            Humans have been artificially selecting
                            organisms throughout history, but people
                            have been queasy about CRISPR-- which
                            forces these genetic traits and isn't completely
                            "natural".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Gene Flow: GM crops and natural crops interbreeding.
                            Solutions include a "terminator seed", which would
                            cause farmers to have to buy new seeds every year.
                            "buffer zones" are also just physical spacing between
                            GM and natural crops. But the question is what's the
                            difference? <b>THERE ISN'T!</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What about toxic plants? There have been plants that
                            naturally produce pesticides-- BT crops. That wouldn't
                            be dangerous for humans though, as would only be poisonous
                            to insects. Mainly, the criticism of this technology
                            isn't upon the technology itself, but on the way agriculture
                            is, and the companies that do agriculture.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Positive examples: In Bangladesh, GM eggplants have been able
                            to replace pesticides with BT crops, and it helped the farmer's
                            healths, more money, and more growth. Mainly, we're trying to
                            engineer plants resistant to climate change.
