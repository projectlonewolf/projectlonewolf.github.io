                            The "Bias Analysis" article was an activity for our class
                            to analyze and try to notice how some articles can be biased,
                            and it's important to be able to notice and observe these
                            things so we can prevent misinformation and fake news.

                        <p>
                            The article argues that the activists in wealthy countries and
                            conditions such as the US and Europe are blocking African countries
                            to erradicating malaria in their country, while the same has been
                            done in the US and European countries such as Italy. Therewhich have
                            had been no negative side-effects if they had used CRIPR.
                            Wiping them out in African would be safer, as it wouldn't kill
                            other organisms in the ecosystem such as plants, birds, etc.
