                        <p>
                            Today we watched and took notes on the <i>Human Nature</i> documentary!
                        </p>

                            </h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            In today's class, we worked on the avatar activity,
                            where we "created" our "perfect" human, who would
                            fit in best with society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I worked with Theo, and at the start we disagreed
                            with each other, and I thought that we should've
                            made the avatar be the "middle" of all social groups
                            and standards and society, but Theo insisted that
                            we should have just made the avatar as something
                            society would view as "perfect", which is what we
                            ended up doing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We shared what we did with the class, and I was
                            a little surprised, but not really with how basically
                            everyone created a <b>straight, white, male</b>. This
                            although I expected it, I was still a bit surprised.
                        </p>

                            Additionally, the use of power and privilege in society
                            is something that we should all really think of, and be
                            aware of and be able to understand and appreciate our own
                            power and privilege over other people who are <u>not</u>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In one of our discussions, we talked about the difference
                            of privilege between men and women as when women behave
                            a certain way, they are slut-shamed by society, but when
                            men behave in the same manner, they are "praised" for
                            their actions.
                        </p>
