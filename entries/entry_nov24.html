                        <p>
                            Today we watched a docu-series named "Unnatural Selection" about the implications and impact of genetic engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While watching the first episode, I <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RRfwuLnLGAHLH4RqTONX24PI4W3nhnfW0kVDUGBM3Y/edit?usp=sharing">annotated</a>
                            who was talking about what, and their insights and perspectives on the topic of genetic engineering.
                            One of the people I found the most interesting was the scientist who actually invented CRISPR,
                            Jennifer Doudna, which is actually is a pretty big coincidnece as her last name ends with "DNA"!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A question I still have though, is why is it so important that it's regulated?
                            Why can't scientists just do what they want? I get the fact that they have to
                            follow laws and regulations, but what could the <u>negative</u> implications of curing a deadly disease
                            such as HIV be?
                        </p>
