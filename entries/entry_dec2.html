                            Today we finished the first episode a docu-series named "Unnatural Selection" about the implications and impact of genetic engineering.

                        <p>
                            Scientists have been able to develop a new method
                            to engineer and modify gentic code, allowing them
                            to cure diseases, improve health, change both the
                            somatic and gamete cells of an organism, or even
                            humans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            CRSIPR, developed by Jennifer Doudna and her team,
                            has been able to help efficiently edit and modify
                            genomes thus allowing for any change to be made
                            almost instantaneously. The protein Cas-9
                            was originally discovered in a bacterium, and has
                            been used ever since. Although there are alternatives,
                            CRISPR Cas-9 is the most efficient and effective
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although there are both ethical and legal implications
                            to genetic engineering, the field has progressed so
                            much and so quickly that laws haven't caught up with
                            its technology and progress, thus allowing for it
                            to be used.

                            One example of its use is a dog breeder that engineers
                            their dogs' genes to make them more intelligent and more
                            agressive, or better yet, whatever he wants. Another example
                            is a geneticist who is selling CRISPR DIY kits to anyone
                            online, allowing people to make their own genetic modifications
                            such as the dog breeder. This geneticist, Isaiah Zayner was
                            also the first person to inject themselves with CRISPR,
                            which genetically modified the injected/affected cells to
                            grow more muscle.
