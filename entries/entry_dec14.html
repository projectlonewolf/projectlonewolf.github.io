                            Today we read and talked about a case studies of the use of PGD
                            and its ethical use-case and implications.

                            Helen wants a child.  She isn't aiming to create a perfect child but she wants to undergo genetic selection treatment. Helen has a problem with her DNA. It doesnâ€™t affect her health, but it means that most of her eggs don't carry all the genes needed for a baby to grow healthily. The result is that each time she becomes pregnant, she miscarries.

                            Doctors suggest that Helen try a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Using PGD scientists can screen embryos outside the womb, long before they develop into babies. They can select just those embryos that carry healthy genes. This ensures the baby is free from genetic abnormalities. Genetic technology seems the only way she can have a baby at all. If Helen has a child this way, the embryo will be created from one of Helen's eggs and her husband's sperm, just as in IVF. The genes will not be altered, or enhanced in any way. The doctors simply choose an embryo that doesn't carry Helen's genetic disorder.

                            IVF is an extremely expensive treatment that most families cannot afford. What are the implications of this? How might this impact some people?
                            Would you allow Helen to have the treatment?
                            Reason for your choice:

                            I would say yes! Theo and I discussed this, and we
                            agreed upon the idea that it should definitely be
                            allowed and legal, as it's just a couple who wants
                            a healthy child, and it's not a big deal if they
                            decide to proceed with this, as it guarantees that
                            their offspring is as healthy as possible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although we beleive it should be allowed, we do see
                            how it can lead to inequality between people who can
                            afford it and those who can't; but that's invevitable
                            with anything.
